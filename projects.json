    "description": "<p>I started this project as part of my college degree, and it ultimately became the most layered and rewarding project I've undertaken.</p><br>    <p>Having grown up in a religious community, I recognized several opportunities to enhance communication and planning within such settings. This insight inspired me to create <strong>Church Connect</strong>.</p><br> <p>My primary goal was to deepen my expertise in Node.js and React, particularly at a production level. To achieve this, I invested significant time in research and developed an efficient approach to coding on both the backend and frontend. I adhered to MVC and SOLID principles, which greatly enhanced my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.</p><br>   <p>On the backend, I built a RESTful API from the ground up using Node.js and Express. The codebase was organized into routes, controllers, services, and data access layers for each database entity, ensuring high standards of code quality, maintainability, scalability, and security.</p><br>    <h2 class='text-2xl' style='color: #d6d3d1'>Key Features</h2>\n    <ul class='list-decimal'>\n        <li><strong>Custom User Authentication</strong> | Implemented using JWT tokens to secure the platform.</li>\n        <li><strong>Role-Based Access Control</strong> | Three primary user roles with conditional access based on user permissions.</li>\n        <li><strong>Dynamic Content Feed</strong> | A main feed displaying various post types (e.g., Events, Announcements), with user interaction through comments.</li>\n        <li><strong>Event Management</strong> | Creation of groups and tasks within events, allowing for user assignment to specific tasks.</li>\n        <li><strong>Centralized Calendar</strong> | A unified calendar displaying all events for easy access and planning.</li>\n        <li><strong>Group Chat</strong> | Integrated with the Stream API to enable real-time communication within groups.</li>\n        <li><strong>Attendance Tracking</strong> | Attendance is managed via QR codes assigned to each member, facilitating efficient tracking at events.</li>\n    </ul>",

After completing a Vue course, to master its ups and downs, I decided to build a note-taking app. To focus on diving deep into this front-end framework, I kept the backend simple—actually, I didn’t use a backend at all, opting to store all the data in local storage.</p> <br><p>I drew design inspiration from Dribbble and then got to work. Through this project, I practiced my JavaScript skills while deepening my understanding of key Vue concepts such as the virtual DOM, computed properties and watchers, event handling, and routing with Vue Router. I also created a store using Pinia.</p><br> <h2 class='text-2xl' style='color: #d6d3d1'>Key Features</h2><ul><li>CRUD operations (frontend only) for notes and to-dos.</li>\n        <li>Trash functionality.</li>\n        <li>Filtering notes based on tags.</li>\n        <li>Clean and modern layout.</li>\n        <li>Search functionality.</li>\n    </ul>",

    "description": "<p>This was my first major project in WordPress, which I worked on during my summer internship in 2023 at Code Baker Web. The client, based in Australia, wanted to build a custom shop for his merchandise.</p><br>\n\n<p>We used a page builder for the simple main pages, but we had to develop a custom plugin from scratch to create <strong>shortcodes</strong> for the product archive page, checkout page, and single product page. This project gave me the opportunity to practice my PHP and JavaScript skills, as I wrote code for the custom plugin. It also introduced me to WordPress and WooCommerce development.</p><br>\n\n<p>My primary responsibilities included implementing the design for all the pages, writing CSS in <strong>SASS</strong> format with variables for better reusability, and working on the checkout page, where users needed the ability to <strong>upload multiple files</strong>, such as logos to be inscribed on the merchandise.</p><br><p>The client requested a preview feature for each product within a modal. To implement this, we wrote jQuery code with Ajax to make <strong>API calls</strong> from the frontend to the WordPress backend. This allowed us to retrieve and display the necessary data for each product</p>",

    "description": "<p>The SwagNSend team wanted to redesign their website, so Bogdan from Code Baker Web reached out to me for this new project. I received the design files in Adobe Illustrator and got to work. Building on the foundation of the previous design and expanding the custom plugin we had already created was a significant advantage, making the job smoother overall.</p><br>\n\n<p>Of course, I encountered some challenges with certain design elements, but nothing that couldn’t be resolved with some tried-and-true CSS and JavaScript. The main challenge this time was coding the mini-cart from scratch, which involved making API calls through Ajax for real-time updates on the frontend. I also had to create the filters for the archive and checkout pages from scratch.</p><br>\n\nIn the end, this project significantly deepened my web development knowledge across multiple areas. I believe that the SwagNSend experience (both the initial and this follow-up project) has been invaluable for an inexperienced developer like me. I learned a great deal.",
